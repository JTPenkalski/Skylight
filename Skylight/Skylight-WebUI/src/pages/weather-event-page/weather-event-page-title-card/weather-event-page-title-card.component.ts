A moderate risk was issued by the SPC on April 27 for areas further south in Oklahoma, where a deadly nocturnal event unfolded with many supercell thunderstorms and tornadoes tracking over towns several times. Millions were put under a particularly dangerous situation (PDS) tornado watch on April 27, and several PDS tornado warnings were issued that night as numerous strong tornadoes touched down. The outbreak served as the beginning of a broader 16-day period of constant severe weather and tornado activity across the United States that would continue until May 10.';
